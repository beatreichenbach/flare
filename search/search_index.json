Each lens element specifies a refractive index and Abbe number. Using those values the renderer finds the glass with the closest values and uses that to caluclate the dispersion. Different manufacturers might have glasses with different qualities that give unique looks.</p> <p><code>abbe_nr_adjustment</code>: Offset for all Abbe numbers in the prescription. This can be used to add more or less dispersion to the glasses. Adjusting this value overrides the lens prescription and is here to for creative experimentation.</p> <p><code>coating_lens_elements</code>: List of anti-reflective coatings for lens elements in a prescription. The refractive index depends on the material used for the coating (for example MgF2 with an index of 1.38.) The wavelength is the wavelength in nm that the coating is optimized for to reduce reflection.</p>"},{"location":"reference/flare/#starburst","title":"Starburst","text":"<p>The starburst pattern is the bright glare that appears where the light source is.</p> <p><code>aperture</code>:  Aperture Parameters</p> <p><code>intensity</code>: Intensity of the Starburst pattern</p> <p><code>lens_distance</code>: Distance from the sensor picking up the pattern to the aperture that is producing it</p> <p><code>blur</code>: Blur amount</p> <p><code>rotation</code>: Rotation amount</p> <p><code>rotation_weighting</code>: Weighting towards 1 will make the values on the outside of the rotation brighter</p> <p><code>fadeout</code>: Range (from and to of the radius) of the fadeout.
